diane's block

first, add a level option that effectively says "don't save here, if ogmo dies revert to the last level that didn't have the 'don't save here' tag"

then, add a checkpoint system that stores the level and can revert to the stored version. this helps build on the below

"diane's block" is just a really fancy packaging of a "sublevel" feature:
you go into diane's block, and it sends you to a sublevel
after leaving the sublevel, you end up back in the previous level with nothing changed except that diane's block has disappeared (with you centered at its position) and your momentum/jump state/being-launched-from-cannon state from when you exited the sublevel is preserved

basics would be specifying a level transition as a "sublevel" transition that doesn't stop the music and stores the current position/level state so it can be re-entered after a "sublevel exit" transition (and also sends the player back to the last
only one player can enter a sublevel and only one player can exit, other players will be kept in the normal level

the more i wrote this out the more i realized how much work this would require. oh well. save it for later in the project i guess
