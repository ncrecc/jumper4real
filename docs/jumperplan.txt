this file is VERY OLD and is for our idea of a jumper fangame back in may 2018 when we could not write a single line of code!!! except for isaac audio mods maybe. lotsa inspiration here (maybe), though also obviously a lot of this is from jumper itself, and less obviously some of it is from the old jumper fangame "jumper: the opposing forces"

plum-mo: original character doo not stael!!!1!1
ogmo: hey, i know this guy.
cratemo: unfortunately, johnson's boss did not believe that it grew legs and walked away.
kawaiimo: leading cause of diabetes in the east coast.
crude-examplemo: writes placeholder text for a living.

just a regular block. you can stand on it, you can push on it, you can hit yer head on it.

-this is known in the industry as a moving platform. anything that's on top of it will move with it. this is a small one that goes left and right, reversing direction whenever it hits a wall or a "reverse direction" marker.
-a tiny little platform that goes up and down.
-at two blocks long, this ain't your average platform! the way it goes left and right is average though.
-an extra-large platform that traverses the two vertical directions.

-yoku blocks automatically toggle between solidity and non-solidity, and they can be configured so you can get precisely the pattern you need.
--low security: if something's in the way when this tries to close, then it will stay open and continue with its pattern once there are no objects in its way. this will desynchronize it from its intended pattern, which is sometimes what the player needs to do!
--med security: if this is blocked from closing, it will simply remain open as long as it has to, then snap back to its intended pattern once nothing is in the way.
--high security: if this closes on something, that "something" will either die or be shattered into millions of tiny pieces.

-red switch blocks can be toggled by means of a red floor switch. non-solid red blocks will become solid while solid red blocks will be come non-solid.
-blue switch blocks are like red switch blocks, but blue, so they're only toggled by - any guesses? no? - a blue floor switch.
--low security: if something's in the way when it tries to become solid, it ends up not changing state.
--med security: if an object's in the way while this is trying to close, it will stay open and snap to its intended state once nothing is in its way. (if you toggle a switch which prevents it from closing, then toggle it again so it's naturally open, then it won't try to automatically close)
--high security: don't get in the way when this tries to close...

[
-all doors come in an upper part and a lower part. "open" means the upper and lower parts slide up/down, "closed" means that the upper and lower parts stay where they're supposed to be. doors can also come in horizontal form, where the parts slide left/right.
electric door: open while either type of electricity is on. (gray with electricity sign)
star door: open once no stars of any kind are in the level. (light yellow with star sign)
arrow door: open once all arrows are inactive at once. (dark yellow with up arrow sign)
button door: open while all green buttons are pushed down. (green with short down arrow sign)
or button door: open while any green button is pushed down. (lime with short up arrow sign)
ghost door: open once all ghost blocks are eliminated. (purple with cartoon ghost sign)
or ghost door: open once any ghost block is eliminated. (red with upside-down ghost)
]--reverse: this is closed when it's supposed to be open, and vice-versa. this will give the door reverse coloring - the darkish color of the sign will be swapped with the lightish coloring of the door.

yellow switch: flip it to disable yellow electricity, moving platforms, sentry blocks, and conveyers. (has an electricity sign. gray while off. any objects that are "disabled" will appear darker than normal)

blue switch: flip it to disable blue electricity, yoku blocks, launchers, and cannons. (has a reversed electricity sign. gray while off. any objects that are "disabled", yadda yadda, yoku blocks remain in their currrent state while off, launchers are solid while off.)

sentry block: it's stuck to the background and can't actually go anywhere. fires at the closest ogmo every 2 seconds, unless they're too close to it, or they're enemy ogmos who don't get shot at because hey i don't know.

decorations: these are purely for visual effect. none of these can affect an ogmo in any way.
-left arrow: to the left, to the left.
-up arrow: hey, cheer up.
-right arrow: maybe you're right!
-down arrow: don't get down on yourself.

spikes facing upwards. they almost hurt as much as spikes facing downwards.
spikes facing downwards. they almost hurt as much as spikes facing to the left.
spikes facing to the left. they almost hurt as much as spikes facing to the right.
spikes facing to the right. they almost hurt as much as spikes facing upwards.
spikes facing EVERYWHERE! also known as a spikeball.

this fire doesn't seem to be moving any time soon, but beware it nonetheless!
a fireball which oscillates in a horizontal manner!
a fireball that goes up ("Going Down" DLC is $4.99)

this block stays in the air with the help of its dust-removing fan. so long as an ogmo doesn't step on it. if the fan is inactive, it's basically a steel crate. if it lands on a surface, and then that surface disappears from under it, it will become active again.
-this block stays in the air, don't ask why, and it explodes after an ogmo touches it.

this is a ghost block. it moves as its corresponding ogmo moves. if it dies, the ogmo dies, and vice versa. if it ever touches its corresponding ogmo, it is destroyed.

conveyors can move around many things, including crates, steel crates, inactive falling blocks, and ogmos. (ogmoes?)

steel crates are heavy. it will move if it's on top of something moving - a conveyor, a platform - but it cannot be pushed by a platform or an ogmo.

a crate is a crate, as you ought to know. it can always be pushed by a little ogmo.

any moving thingmabobs will change direction if they hit this dot.

doublejump arrow: if you've already used up your doublejump, hit this arrow to get another.
-think doublejump arrows are too easy to catch? wait until you see this horizontally moving one.
-a doublejump arrow that moves up and down, kind of like you!

follower blocks will move to the closest ogmo they can find, but they'll be destroyed by spikes and tnt. this is a plain one that moves horizontally.
-this follower block moves vertically. it's fun to wall-jump off of!
-here's a spiky follower block! it will die if it touches normal spikes, but not another spiky follower block. it moves horizontally as its closest ogmo moves.
-a block that follows you in a vertical manner, while simultaneously being spiky.

this is a big ol' cube of tnt. when it falls and hits something, it lets out an explosion that destroys whatever it hit.

yellow circuit swapper: when you hit this button, yellow voltage is swapped. previously low-voltage areas are now high-voltage, while high-voltage areas are low-voltage!
blue circuit swapper: you know what the yellow circuit swapper does? this only applies to blue electricity.

yellow electricity: if you touch any high-voltage part of it, you're zapped dead.
blue electricity: technology works. technology... delivers.
