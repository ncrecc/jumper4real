Hi! It's me, Titku. I wanted to write about Choice a little.
Choice is vaguely inspired by a handful of things:
1. A lot of how N++ screwed around with its option menu, from *unlocking options as you progress through the game* to weird settings like "Numberwang" which just multiply your displayed progress percentage. Probably the key influence was the "Is It Art?" setting, which can be "yes", "no", or "maybe", which seems to do nothing, but actually reports back which setting you chose as sort of an impromptu survery of everyone who checked the option menu as to whether the game qualifies as art.
2. An old TIGSource April Fools' game, the name of which we no longer remember, where the gist was that the game is personalized among ~20 different versions depending on the first character of the player's username on their operating system. For example: for us, the physics were tweaked so that the second room was impossible to beat. Others got luckier, but even then there was plenty of variance: some had floatier physics, some had faster enemies, some had harder rooms, some had pretentious roomnames, etc. This idea of separate experiences per player influenced Choice even before we realized Choice should probably be randomized for each new save file.
3. The way game mechanics combined with preexisting levels can influence community. If there ever were a community for this game, our goal would be to promote having different short sidepaths or even just slightly different challenges based on the player's Choice.

I'm not sure when exactly we came up with Choice, but I believe it was some time between August and October of 2021. J4R was first initialized October 10th, 2021, with some lazy map loading code copy-and-pasted from our first LOVE project started on September 5th, 2021, with Choice's first known written appearance appearing in a "todo" file created October 17th, 2021.
