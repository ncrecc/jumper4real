We define imaginary numbers as numbers of the form *ix*, where i is the square root of -1 and x is nonzero and nonimaginary, as not to defeat the point. We define complex numbers as numbers of the form *a + bi* where a and b are nonimaginary and bi rights.

In contrast, we define **real** numbers as numbers of the form *x*, where... uh... x is real.

Since this game, easily deemable Jumper 4 due to its association with the "Jumper" series, is neither being multiplied by i nor being added with a number that is multiplied by i, we can deduce the following:

**Jumper 4 Real**.

Applied interpretations may include the following:
- Jumper 4 Real is named as it is because it is no longer an imaginary epic concept for a Jumper game never to come, and is now being made into a reality. Gradually.
- "Jumper 4 Real" is a pun on both the game's unofficial designation as the fourth in the Jumper series and a flagrant misspelling of the phrase "Jumper, for real".
- Jumper 4 Real has very little complexity, try as we might to overcomplicate things.
- Jumper 4 Real has no imagination... ouch!
- The name is merely a reference to the common meme of netizens shouting "OMG %s REAL" when something is allegedly shown to exist. This has been deemed the least likely possibility due to its lack of mathematical pseudowit.
