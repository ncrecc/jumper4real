Listen here, compadre. I happen to be the only man available when it comes to the gem business. You got gemstones? You're bringin' em here. "Monopoly" is such an ugly word - why don't we call it "I'm actually the only person who accepts gems since they're nearly worthless but I think they're pretty and shiny so if you bring me them I'll give you stuff in return"?
You scratch my back, I scratch yours. You pat my head, I pat your head. Quid pro quo, que sera sera, yo siento stimmy, capiche?
