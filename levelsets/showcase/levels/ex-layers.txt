|every level is composed of up to 9 layers. (you can have more, but the editor doesn't support more than 9 layers yet.)\nthis layer system is what allows for meta-objects to be placed on other objects, such as the invisible numbers that govern what exit a door or win tile leads to, as well as allowing for intricate designs like what you've seen in the lobby.
|unlike knytt stories, tiles are collidable or non-collidable regardless of what layer they're on. this lets you do tricks like placing a non-collidable tile on top of a collidable tile.\nthat's what's going on here: the standard "background wall" tile is placed on top of the "foreground wall" tile.\nin practice, though, there's an "invisible block" tile that fills this niche and should be used in stead, so that you can see it if you have the "see the unseeable" setting on.
|tiles are rendered in order of what layer they belong to.\nobjects, on the other hand, follow a more strict order. solid objects render above nonsolid objects, and all objects render above tiles, no matter what layer they're on.\nideally, this is juat temporary behavior, and in the future objects (including ogmo) will take layers into account when rendering.
|every level has a background color behind everything. in "inside" levels, you can just cover it up with "background wall" tiles, or you can just set the background color to something that denotes you're inside.\n\nalso, a fun fact. that dirt with grass on it is actually two separate tiles, "grass" and "dirt", and can be constructed as such, but there's also another "tile" that has grass and dirt combined into one layer for convenience.
